A lightweight API to manage your Configs easily.

Check out the ["Getting started"]() page to get started immediately.

## How it works

This mod makes easy *loading*, _managing_ and _deleting_ your configs at runtime.<br/>

The whole purpose of this mod is to have a simple and easy-to-follow api,
so you can start creating your configs as fast as possible and also make them platform-independent,
so that you can use it with all the mod loaders you like.

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Infinituum17/FastConfigAPI/wiki) to get started.

## Additional resources

This mod uses [Void Lib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/void-lib),
so if you're using [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), and you're interested in integrating some advanced
functionalities using annotations in your mod, you should check it out.
